# React App using ChatEngine.IO

This Microsoft teams clone app was created using the React Js libraries and ChatEngine.IO to handle all backend. 
Image handling, message avatars, react hooks, sockets and chatengine-io specific functions were 
learnt during the process. 

We later deployed the app to Netlify here: https://chat-app-pomeranian.netlify.app/.
